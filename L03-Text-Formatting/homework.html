        I am a student at Bergen Tech studying Computer Science. I love to play the piano and played at Carnegie Hall. I have been playing piano for more than five years. I also like to listen to rock music such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, or Bon Jovi. I'm learning how to code and I'm having lots of fun with HTML.
